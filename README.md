# Memory Game

I built this demo project to explore more about [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and learn about [server components](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#server-components).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Tech stack
#### NextJS

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Some of the main Next.js features include:

* Routing: A file-system based router built on top of Server Components that supports layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more.
* Rendering: Client-side and Server-side Rendering with Client and Server Components.
* Data Fetching
* Styling: Support for styling methods as CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, and CSS-in-JS
* Optimizations

#### TypeScript
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). NextJS comes with built-in TypeScript support for automatically installing the necessary packages and configuring the proper settings.

#### Tailwind
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). A utility-first CSS framework that works exceptionally well with Next.js.

#### Supabase
[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) to store the user's session and storage the game info.
